                        <p className="intro">Hi! I'm originally from the SF Bay Area. I went to Georgetown University in DC for undergrad where I played Women's Golf and studied Classics. I then went to law school at Washington University in St. Louis where I became interested in employment law, which led me to explore careers in HR and Talent. I wanted to get into tech so I pursued opportunities in recruiting, starting at a firm (Riviera) then going in house to Instacart, Snapchat, and Uber between 2013-2019. I left to start Talentdrop!</p>
